    To start playing, you will need to setup some things first.<br>
        <br>
            Click on "buildings" at the top in the menu.  You will need to purchase 100 homes and 100 farms.<br>
            This will allow you to start making money from taxes on your residents.  The basic goal is to keep<br>
